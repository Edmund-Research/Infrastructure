Network Digital Twin for Proactive Threat Mitigation
====================================================

Summary
~~~~~~~~
As financial institutions increase their reliance on hybrid infrastructure and multi-cloud environments, the complexity of defending against 
sophisticated cyber threats has grown. This business case proposes a Network Digital Twin (NDT) to simulate, observe, and preemptively respond 
to threats by creating a virtual replica of the live environment, incorporating AI-driven threat simulations and real-time security control feedback.

Business Alignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Risk Management** - Enables proactive threat detection and security control validation before real-world exposure.

**Regulatory Compliance** -	Provides evidence of robust risk assessments and controls for ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, PCI-DSS.

**Operational Efficiency** - Reduces downtime, patch delays, and incident response fatigue.

**Innovation Enablement** -	Supports R&D of secure architectures without affecting production systems.

Solution Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Core Components:

**Network Digital Twin Layer**: Replicates infrastructure (VMs, firewalls, SDN, multi-cloud links).

**AI Simulation Agents**: Generate realistic threat scenarios based on historical data and evolving TTPs.

**Digital Twin Engine**: Synchronizes configs and topology from prod using IaC (Terraform, Ansible).

**Security Control Mirror**: Emulates firewalls, VNFs, IAM, segmentation, etc.

**SIEM Feed Integration**: Azure Sentinel, Splunk, or ELK Stack ingests twin + prod logs for correlation.

**CI/CD Loopback**: Validated improvements pushed to production automatically.

Potential drawbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. *Cost*

**Drawback**: High compute/storage for large environments.

**Mitigation**: Use a scoped twin per critical segment (e.g., core banking only).

2. *Complexity*

**Drawback**: Requires cross-team coordination (SecOps, NetOps, Cloud).

**Mitigation**: Embed InfraOps practices & automate onboarding scripts.


3. *Data Drift*

**Drawback**: The Digital twin may fall out of sync with production.

**Mitigation**: Use IaC + drift detection tools like Terraform Cloud or Azure Bicep.


4. *AI Overreach*

**Drawback**: Poorly tuned agents may generate unrealistic attack scenarios.

**Mitigation**:  Fine-tune agents on internal attack logs and adversary emulation frameworks.


Possible Metrics for Success
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reduction in post-deployment high/critical vulnerabilities.

Faster MTTR through pre-trained incident runbooks.

A drop in change rollbacks due to tested configurations.

Full mapping of twin to compliance control checks (RA-5, CP-4, IR-8).
