====================================================================
Integrated SIEM for Infrastructure Monitoring & Compliance Reporting
====================================================================

Objective
~~~~~~~~~
Deploy a centralized, integrated Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform to collect, analyze, and respond to events across hybrid infrastructure (Azure, multi-cloud, and on-prem). This supports compliance (e.g., PCI-DSS, ISO 27001), security visibility, and operational oversight in financial environments.

Context & Problem Statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Financial institutions operate within:

1. Complex multi-tier infrastructures (cloud, on-prem, edge).

2. Regulatory environments requiring continuous, auditable security monitoring.

3. A high volume of disparate logs and security signals from firewalls, VMs, containers, SDN controllers, etc.

Problems include:

1. Tool and visibility fragmentation across cloud providers and legacy systems.

2. Manual compliance reporting and weak correlation between infra events and threats.

3. Slow detection and response due to a lack of context-aware monitoring.

Proposed Solution: Centralized, Integrated SIEM Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ðŸ”¹ Core Components

SIEM Platform (Azure Sentinel preferred)

  Cloud-native, scalable, and ML-enhanced SIEM tool.
  
  Correlates events across cloud workloads, endpoints, on-prem devices, and network telemetry.

Data Connectors & Agents

  Built-in integrations with Azure, AWS, GCP, VMware, Palo Alto, and Syslog-based legacy infra.
  
  Lightweight agents on critical servers and VNFs.

Infrastructure-Specific Parsers & Workbooks

  Custom rules for InfraOps logs (e.g., Terraform, Ansible), SDN/NFV telemetry, container and VM audit logs.
  
  Dashboards tailored for infra-level incident views.

SOAR Integration (Security Orchestration, Automation, Response)

  Automated playbooks to quarantine VMs, rotate keys, raise tickets, or enforce policies in real time.

Compliance Reporting Engine

  Generate auditable evidence for controls and policy violations.
  
  Automated PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, SOC2 mapping with infra logs and metrics.

Benefits
~~~~~~~~~
**Threat Detection**: Cross-layer correlation of anomalies and infra misconfiguration.

**Compliance & Auditing**: One-click compliance reports with timestamped policy events.

**Operational Efficiency**: Centralizes logs, reduces swivel-chair monitoring.

**Risk Reduction**: Real-time insights and proactive response reduce breach exposure.

**Scalability**: Cloud-native ingestion from distributed cloud/on-prem assets.


Metrics for Success
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Low average detection-to-response time.

High coverage of critical infrastructure in SIEM ingestion.

Automation coverage for common infrastructure security incidents.

Time saving during internal/external audits.

Oversight & Security Advantages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Unified Visibility**: Consolidates alerts from SDN, cloud, servers, and containers.


**Proactive Defense**: Detects behavioral anomalies and privilege misuse early.


**Auditable Trail**: All infra changes, access events, and remediations logged and reportable.


**Policy Feedback Loop**: InfraOps teams can adjust policies based on SIEM insights.


Potential Drawbacks & Mitigations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**High Ingestion Volume Costs**: Use filtered log sources, archival retention tiers.

**Alert Fatigue from Poor Rules**: Phase-wise rule tuning, use MITRE ATT&CK and baseline profiling.

**Integration with Legacy Systems**: Leverage Syslog/NXLog connectors and custom parsing logic.
